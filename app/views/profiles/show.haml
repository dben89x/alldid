							Coarse
							These strands have the widest and largest circumferences and this makes them the strongest of all hair textures.

							Medium
							This is the middle of the road for thickness of hair strands; neither too small nor too big.

							Fine
							The circumference is extremely small and narrow, making it delicate and easy to damage.
